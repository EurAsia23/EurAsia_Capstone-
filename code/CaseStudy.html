           <b>claim: </b> <b>How has later school start times improved the health of students</b>
            <p></p>

            The case study I found was a thesis of 2 students in the nursing program at Dominican University of California. Their mission was to find the effects that sleep deprivation has on college students, mainly the ones also in the same nursing program and how this can cause presudal issues and decreased cognitive function.  They did this by having 100 students

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col border border-dark bg-secondary bg-opacity-25 ">
                <b>Their main focus:</b> is to study the effects of sleep deprivation in college students, bringing awareness how sleep deprivation is harmful if not corrected so they also find  ways to fix this problem.  The research they do on the cognitive function of students and how that makes them have more procedural errors leads to a lack of focus and increases the amount of academic errors.  This research is done by two senior students in the nursing program at Dominican University in California. These students saw a common problem in their school and did their senior thesis discussing  a prevalent problem.

              <div class="col border border-dark bg-secondary bg-opacity-25 ">
                The role that technology had in the case study was helping the search take place, they use multiple social media platforms to find eligible students willing to take part in the study. They also used gmail, facebook, and instagram to catch up on progress in the sleep study.

              <div class="col border border-dark bg-secondary bg-opacity-25">
                How technology has helped in the case study is by helping the students stay connected throughout the study. They had other college students report back their sleep patterns and witness the procedural errors that students were making with the lack of sleep. The students also used articles from other sources to back their research. How technology could be used to make it better is by connecting an actual sleep study, i can't find many that went into detail but having students diagnosed with sleep deprivation and seeing their sleep patterns and daily activities. Having a sleep study where they scan their brain and see if they are shrinking in the frontal cortex.

            The implication from the case study that applies to my website is cognitive function, and how the brain is affected by a lack of sleep. Also how the damage to the brain at an early age can cause long term effects. <p></p> <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/features/schools-start-too-early.html

          <div class="col border border-dark bg-secondary bg-opacity-25">
            Also how to include college students  in my topic because many college students are good examples of being young but having more demanding workloads so the added stress will also help people see how pushing back school times has really helped students. Another implication that I'll put into my website is how these students saw a problem and did their own research to help bring awareness to others.
