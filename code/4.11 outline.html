    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-8 border border-dark"> Sleep deprivation is the leading cause of the decline in student health because the biological sleep pattern in adolescents causes students to sleep later and wake up later. 
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4 border border-dark">Implication: This impact is the nationwide call for later school times, as research shows that students need more sleep. Also, bring to attention the importance of talking to and understanding students other than the surface level of just their attendance. 
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row row-cols-2">
      <div class="col border border-dark"> There is ample research available on the biology of sleep, specifically about adolescents. This body of research details adolescents' unique circadian rhythms, patterns of later melatonin release, and bio-regulatory processes (delayed phase preference) associated with later evening sleepiness,  Even a moderate increase in sleep (30 minutes to one hour) over a period of time has shown to be associated with increased scores on various performance tasks (e.g., reaction times and memory tests) for youth;
      </div>
      <div class="col border border-dark"> This evidence supports my claim because students' bodies release melatonin, a chemical that makes people tired and is produced later than adults or children. This causes students to fall asleep later, and the early school start times interpret the natural times that students would wake up, causing sleep deprivation. 
      </div>
      <div class="col border border-dark"> Studies have shown that sleep deprivation can lead to metabolic and cognitive disturbances in brain areas involved in learning, memory, and emotion, such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex (Havekes et al., 2012).
      </div>
      <div class="col border border-dark">Reasoning#2: This evidence supports my claim because interrupted sleep and poor sleep patterns cause the frontal lobe in the brain to shrink, connecting to the  deterioration of involvement in reasoning, planning, memory and problem-solving
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h1 class="display-4 text-center">Root cause #2</h1>
  <div class="container text-center border border-dark bg-info text-dark bg-opacity-25">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-8 border border-dark">  The link between sleep deprivation and academic achievement causes the later school start times by evidence shown through studies that students that sleep more get better grades.

      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4 border border-dark">Implication: This impacts my topic because it enforces how starting school s later helps the student's well-being and gives them an extra advantage to be great in school. Allowing their brains to wake up fully helps them with their schoolwork.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row row-cols-2">
      <div class="col border border-dark"> Evidence#1: These authors also reported that more sleep and later weekday rise times were associated with better grades and a higher motivation to do well in school. In a further critical review of the literature relating sleep loss to learning capacity and academic performance, researchers found evidence that sleep loss was associated with poorer memory, computational speed, problem-solving, verbal creativity, abstract thinking, executive functioning, and other higher-level cognitive functioning (Curcio 2006), all aspects that are related to school performance and educational outcomes.
      </div>
      <div class="col border border-dark"> Reasoning#1: This evidence supports my claim because it shows that sleep is connected to poor academic grades. So pushing back school start times would allow students' brains to absorb the information they are given during the school day and better prepare them for learning. 

      </div>
      <div class="col border border-dark"> Evidence #2:  Adequate sleep improves a studentâ€™s overall health and well-being. Students should get the proper amount of sleep at night to help them stay focused, improve concentration, and improve academic performance.

      </div>
      <div class="col border border-dark">Reasoning #2: The data from the 2015 national and state Youth Risk Behavior Surveys, a CDC study, shows that a majority of middle school and high school students reported getting less than the recommended amount of sleep for their age. Connecting back to students of all backgrounds is affected by a lack of sleep due to school, parents, jobs, etc., but pushing back school start times has helped students be more alert and attentive in class.
